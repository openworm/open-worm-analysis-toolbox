The **Open Worm Analysis Toolbox** is a Python port of the Schafer Lab's [Worm Analysis Toolbox 1.3.4](http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/wormtracker/index.php?action=analysis).

It can be used to process videos of *C. elegans* into statistics so the behaviour of individual worms can be compared.

It is also the package used by the OpenWorm project to determine how closely its simulated worm behaves like real worms. It was started as a sub-project of the [OpenWorm project](https://github.com/openworm).

It is only about 75% complete. Please see:
